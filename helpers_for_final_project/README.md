# Some helper functions for the final project

This folder contains some helper functions for the final project. The functions are the solutions to the previous excercises, which you can just copy and paste into your final project, if you get stucked at some point in our exercises.
You need to adjust the functions to your needs, as they are not directly usable in the final project. For example, you need to change the url in the web_scraper function and the names of the persons in the import_persons function.

Anyway, try to understand the functions and how they work, they should be the last resort if you can't solve the exercises on your own.
