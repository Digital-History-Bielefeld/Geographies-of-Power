    "In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects that share common attributes and behaviors. It allows you to define a set of properties (called attributes) and functions (called methods) that the created objects will possess. Classes promote reusability and organization in code by enabling you to model real-world entities with their characteristics and actions. To define a class, the class keyword is used, followed by the class name and a colon. Inside, an __init__ method (also called a constructor) typically initializes object attributes, while other methods define the object's behavior. By creating instances of a class, you can easily create multiple objects that share the same structure but hold unique data.\n",

    "    self.price = price\n",
    "    self.quantity = quantity\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then add methods to the class:\n",

    "class Product:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, name, price, quantity):\n",

    "    return self.price * self.quantity\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to access the attributes of the class, you can create an object of the class:\n",

This allows each instance of the class to keep its own separate data.\n",
    "For example, if you have a class Dog and define a method like bark(self), using self lets that method access the specific dog's data (like its name or age) when the method is called on that instance. Without self, the method wouldn’t know which instance’s data to use.\n",
