    "## Working with Files\n",
    "\n",
    "[The open() function in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open) is a built-in function used to open and manipulate files. It provides a flexible way to interact with files, allowing you to perform various operations such as reading, writing, and appending. Let's try it out!\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax of the open() function is as follows (most of this you won't need):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "open(file, mode='r', buffering=-1, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None, closefd=True, opener=None)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- file: The name of the file or a path to the file.\n",
    "- mode: Specifies the mode in which the file is opened. It can be 'r' for reading, 'w' for writing, 'a' for appending, and more.\n",
    "- buffering: An optional integer that represents the buffer size. If omitted or set to -1, the system default is used.\n",
    "- encoding: Specifies the encoding of the file, such as 'utf-8' or 'ascii'. Default is None (system dependent).\n",
    "- errors: Specifies how encoding and decoding errors are to be handled.\n",
    "- newline: Controls how universal newlines mode works (None, '', '\\n', '\\r', and '\\r\\n').\n",
    "- closefd: If closefd is False, the underlying file descriptor will not be closed when the file is closed.\n",
    "- opener: A custom opener that can be used to open the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's explore some examples of using the open() function:\n",
    "Example 1: Reading a File\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open a file in read mode\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2: Writing to a File\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open a file in write mode and write some content\n",
    "with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "    file.write(\"This is a sample text written to the file.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3: Appending to a File\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open a file in append mode and add more content\n",
    "with open('output.txt', 'a') as file:\n",
    "    file.write(\"\\nThis is an additional line appended to the file.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples show how to open files in different modes and perform basic operations, read more [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files). As you progress through the exercises, you'll gain a deeper understanding of the open() function and its capabilities.\n",
