    "In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects that share common attributes and behaviors. It allows you to define a set of properties (called attributes) and functions (called methods) that the created objects will possess. Classes promote reusability and organization in code by enabling you to model real-world entities with their characteristics and actions. To define a class, the class keyword is used, followed by the class name and a colon. Inside, an __init__ method (also called a constructor) typically initializes object attributes, while other methods define the object's behavior. By creating instances of a class, you can easily create multiple objects that share the same structure but hold unique data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class in python looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Product:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, name, price, quantity):\n",
    "    self.name = name\n",
    "    self.price = price\n",
    "    self.quantity = quantity\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then add methods to the class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "class Product:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, name, price, quantity):\n",
    "    self.name = name\n",
    "    self.price = price\n",
    "    self.quantity = quantity\n",
    "\n",
    "  def total(self):\n",
    "    return self.price * self.quantity\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to access the attributes of the class, you can create an object of the class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "product = Product(\"apple\", 10, 5)\n",
    "print(product.name) # apple\n",
    "print(product.price) # 10\n",
    "print(product.quantity) # 5\n",
    "print(product.total()) # 50\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "**The Self Parameter**\n",
    "In Python classes, self is a reference to the instance of the class itself. It’s used in methods to access the instance’s attributes and other methods. When you define a method in a class, the first parameter must be self (although it could be named anything, self is the convention). This allows each instance of the class to keep its own separate data.\n",
    "For example, if you have a class Dog and define a method like bark(self), using self lets that method access the specific dog's data (like its name or age) when the method is called on that instance. Without self, the method wouldn’t know which instance’s data to use.\n",

    "So you see, classes are a way to bundle data and functionality together. They are a blueprint for a special \"topic\". If you work with a lot of data, you can create a class for every data type.

If you work with a lot of cars, you can create a class Car. And so on. Then you can bundle all the data and functionality of a product in the class Product.
