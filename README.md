## Introduction

This repository contains the materials and resources for the Python course for Historians which is part of the Blended Intense Programme "Geographies of Power. Studying, Graphing and Comparing Court Records". Various basics will be taught in 4 learning units, including:

- Dealing with GitHub (you're in the middle of it right now, congratulations!) and GitHub Codespaces
- Python3 basics
- NLP
- Basic data analysis for historians

## Why programming for historians?

Programming is a powerful tool for historians. It allows us to automate repetitive tasks, to work with large datasets, and to visualize our data in new ways. Programming can help us to ask new questions and to find new answers. It can also help us to communicate our research to a wider audience. In short:
- **Automation**: Many tasks in the humanities are repetitive and can be automated. This saves time and allows you to focus on the essentials.
- **Data analysis**: The amount of data in the humanities is constantly increasing. With programming, you can analyze and visualize this data.
- **Text analysis**: With programming, you can analyze texts in a way that would be impossible by hand.
- **Web scraping**: With programming, you can extract data from websites and use it for your own purposes.
- **Visualization**: With programming, you can visualize data in a way that would be impossible by hand.

## Why Python?

Python is a programming language that is easy to learn and read. It is widely used in the humanities (among many others) and has a large community. This makes it easy to find help and examples. Its syntax is easy to understand and understandable, as it is relatively close to natural language; and above all, Python is one of the most important languages for applications that could be of interest to historians, for example dealing with texts, data analysis, web-scraping and much more. With Python you have not just one tool in your toolbox, but a whole set of tools that you can use for your individual research.


## Course structure

The aim of the course is to provide you with basic knowledge of the Python programming language. The intention is to give you ideas on how you can continue working with digital methods and take away an initial fear of programming. You should take as much in-depth knowledge as possible that can also be followed up at home and, above all, to bring the advantages of programming for humanities tasks closer.
The workshop is structured as follows: There is a folder for each of the following learning units, which contains the content of the session and is designed to be as interactive as possible. This content is then worked on together and deepened with short inputs. As you are currently in the middle of the first learning unit, let's get started right away!

**Session 1: Python Basics I**
- Introduction to Python
- Variables and data types
- Lists and dictionaries

**Session 2: Python Basics II**
- Flow control
- Strings
- Working with files
- Functions and classes

**Session 3: Natural Language Processing (NLP)**^
- Modules/Packages/Libraries
  - Your own web scraping project
- Introduction to NLP
- Introduction to spaCy & displaCy

**Session 4: Data Analysis for Historians**
Your own project with:
- Rule-based data queries with spaCy
- Regular expressions


## Good to know:

### 1. GitHub
GitHub is a platform that has become an integral part of modern collaborative software development, but is now also used by many other teams as a version control tool. In a nutshell, GitHub is a web-based platform that offers version control and collaboration in the development of software projects. GitHub acts as a centralized hub for managing and collaborating on code. It utilizes a version control system called Git, which tracks changes made to code over time. This ensures that multiple contributors can work on a project simultaneously without conflicts, and it allows developers to roll back to previous versions if needed.
In this course, we will use GitHub to share code and resources. You can find a lot of programming projects on GitHub, and you can also share your own projects with others. If you are new to GitHub, you can find a lot of tutorials and guides on the internet. You can also find some useful links in the [resources](#resources) section.

### 2. GitHub Codespaces
GitHub Codespaces is a feature of GitHub that allows you to create a cloud-based development environment directly within GitHub. This means that you can write, run, and debug your code directly in your browser without having to install any software on your local machine. This is especially useful if you are working on a computer that does not have the necessary software installed, or if you want to work on your code from different devices. In this course, we will use GitHub Codespaces to write and run Python code and ensure that everyone has the same system basis. You can find more information about GitHub Codespaces in the [resources](#resources) section.

### 3. Visual Studio Code
The user interface of a Codespace is based on Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code is a very popular code editor and is used by many developers. It is open source and has a large community, so you can find many extensions and themes for it. It is developed by Microsoft for all systems. It is also very easy to use and has a lot of features that makes it a great choice for programming.

### 4. Jupyter Notebooks
Jupyter Notebooks are a great way to write and run Python code. They allow you to write code in cells and run them individually. This is very useful for testing small pieces of code or for writing code that is not part of a larger program. Jupyter Notebooks are widely used in the data science community and are a great tool for learning Python. You can find more information about Jupyter Notebooks in the [resources](#resources) section. In this course we will work sometimes with Jupyter Notebooks, but mostly we try to train you to work with "normal" Python scripts, so that you can use your knowledge in other environments as well.

-------------------------------------------------------------
## Getting started

To start, all participants must set up a codespace. We will be working with codespaces throughout the course.

Follow the instructions below to open your codespace and dive into a hassle-free and efficient development experience. Enjoy the workshop!

1. Click on the code button at the top right
2. There you have two tabs: "Local" and "Codespaces". Click on "Codespaces"
3. Click on the Plus-Button to create a new codespace
4. A new window opens in which you can see a Visual Studio Code environment. This is your codespace. You can now start working on the content of the first learning unit in folder "session-1".

## Disclaimer

This course is designed for beginners with no prior programming experience. We will cover the basics of Python programming and introduce you to some of the most common libraries used in the humanities. We will also provide you with some resources to help you continue learning on your own. 
While doing this course, you will see that many things are not working as smoothly as we would like them to. 
1.) One the one hand, we are working with raw historical data. Normally, you would have to clean the data first before you can work with it. We skip this (very important) step in this course. But the results are only as good as the data you work with. So if you are working at home with your own data, you should always clean it first. Below, you will find some resources on how to clean (historical) data. Be prepared that this step will take a lot of time.
2.) On the other hand, we are working with a small amount of data. Normally, you would work with much larger data sets. The real power of working with Digital Methods come with large text corpora. But for the beginning, this small data set is enough to get you started. You can also keep in mind: If I would work with the whole webpage, how much time could I save with my Python script?

## Resources

Of course, this course can only show you the basics of Python programming. It's more of a chance to get started in the world of programming. You are strongly encouraged to continue to engage with these topics after this course, as this world has so much to offer and can make your life as a historian much easier. To help you get started, here is a small collection of further resources.

### Python
- [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- [Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/)
- [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
- [Python Tutorials for Digital Humanities](https://www.youtube.com/@python-programming)

- Installing Python on your Computer:
  - https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download
  - You can install a Windows Subsystem for Linux on your Windows computer. This allows you to use a fully functional Linux system (including terminal) under Windows - and much more interactively than with a virtual machine. Here are some instructions: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/
  - https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/introduction-and-installation
  - [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
    - Anaconda is a distribution of Python that comes with a lot of useful packages for data analysis and scientific computing. It also comes with a package manager called conda that makes it easy to install new packages. So it is a good choice for beginners where you have everything in one place. But it is very large and can take up a lot of space on your computer. We also recommend to get used to work with the normal Python installation.

### Cleaning Data
- Regular Expressions:
  - [Regular Expressions in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)
  - We have also prepared a small [project to regular expressions](https://github.com/Digital-History-Bielefeld/WORCK-Training-School-2/tree/main/projects/text_preprocessing_with_regular_expressions) in another course. Feel free to check it out.
- [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/)
  - OpenRefine is a powerful tool for cleaning and transforming messy data. It allows you to import data in various formats, clean it, transform it, and export it in various formats. It is especially useful for cleaning data that is not well-structured or that contains errors.
  - [OpenRefine Tutorial](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/cleaning-data-with-openrefine)
- Another typical tool for cleaning data is breaking down the whole text into its important parts. You can do this best with the [Natural Language Toolkit (nltk)](https://www.nltk.org/) in Python. 
  - We have also prepared a small [project to nltk](https://www.nltk.org/)
